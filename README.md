# Odin Recipes Project

A simple project exploring the basics of html.

The website consists of three pages:
- index.html
- congee.html
- easyshake.html

The index is the main page, linking to the recipes on the site, the other pages are simply recipes with ingredients and instructions on how to make the recipe.

The skills used in this project were:
- Creating the standard html boilerplate
- Creating an appropriate file system architecture
- Creating the home page and links to the other pages
- Strcuturing the pages properly to present the information in the most logical format
